# CSS-pseudo-classes-DEMO
Pseudo-classes enable you to target an element when it's in a particular state, as if you had added a class for that state to the DOM. Pseudo-elements act as if you had added a whole new element to the DOM, and enable you to style that.


This is designed to get familiar with the working of pseudo classes.
